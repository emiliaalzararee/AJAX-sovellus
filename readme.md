## Work Distribution 
I developed the app myself.

## Self-Assesment
I believe I succeeded in completing the project, as all the project criteria were met. My time management was good throughout the project.

Areas for improvement include adding more features to the application.

The application is missing some additional functionalities that could enhance the user experience.

I feel that I have learned a lot, especially about working with APIs, although I could still understand them a bit better.

Things that remained unclear were minimal, but I would like to deepen my understanding of some advanced API integrations in the future.

I would give myself 10/10 p.

## Feedback
The course and in-person instruction have felt clear, organized, and helpful in guiding the project. The explanations and examples provided during lessons supported my learning effectively.

It would support my learning even more if there were additional practical exercises or examples related to APIs and integrating them into projects.

## Information of the application
[Movie App] is an application that allows users to search for movies and view detailed information in a popup card. The app stores the searched movies in the browser's local storage, so users can reopen them later or delete them if they wish. Duplicate movie cards are not saved, keeping the stored list clean and organized.

The main features of the application include:

Searching for movies and displaying details in dynamic popup cards

Storing movie cards in local storage for later access

Deleting movies from the stored list

Preventing duplicate entries

The application is designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and interactive, meeting all the project criteria.

## Technologies
The application was built using HTML, CSS, and native JavaScript. HTML was used to structure the app, while CSS handled the styling and layout. Native JavaScript provided all the dynamic functionality, including creating and displaying popup cards, storing and retrieving movies in localStorage, handling deletion of stored movies, and preventing duplicate entries.

## Thanks
I would like to thank my coursemates, for their moral support throughout the project and my teacher, for answering questions and providing guidance.
